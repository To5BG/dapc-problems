    \begin{itemize}
		\item<+-> \textbf{Problem:} Guess the hidden
            $5$-digit prime in at most $6$ guesses, i.e., play \emph{Primel}.
        \item<+-> First approach: repeatedly guess a random prime satisfying all
            constraints so far.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item<+-> Wrong answer: Occasionally uses $7$ guesses!
        \end{itemize}
		\item<+-> \textbf{Observation:} Many guesses may be needed when only a
            single digit is not known yet.
        \item<+-> \textbf{Solution:} Ensure that the first two $5$-digit primes
            contain all $10$ digits (e.g. $24683$ and $10597$) so that the set
            of digits is known. Then make up to $4$ random consistent guesses.
        \item<+-> This is guaranteed to succeed in $6$ guesses:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item When all digits are distinct, each digit can only be
                    guessed in the wrong location $4$ times, once in the first
                    $2$ guesses, and in $3$ of the $4$ remaining guesses.
                \item When there are at most $4$ distinct digits, each position
                    can only be guessed wrongly at most $3$ times.
            \end{itemize}
            In both cases, the final guess must be correct.
        \item<+-> Note: The hidden test data simply consists of $13$
            test cases covering all $5$-digit primes.
