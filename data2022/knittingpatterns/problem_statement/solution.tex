    \begin{itemize}
        \item<+-> \textbf{Problem:} Given a knitting pattern and amount of wool it costs for letting the wool strand unused, using the
            wool in a stitch, and for starting or ending the use of wool. Compute the minimal amount of wool required
            for every colour of wool.
        \item<+-> \textbf{Observation:} Between two times a colour of wool is used,
            you either leave the strand through the back unused for the entire gap,
            or you immediately end the use at the beginning of the gap and start using it at the end.
        \item<+-> \textbf{Solution:} For every colour, iterate through the knitting pattern and remember the index of the
            last time the colour occurred. If you encounter the colour again, the marginal cost is the minimum
            between leaving the strand unused the whole time since the last time, and the sum of the costs for ending
            and starting. Runs in $\mathcal O(|w| \cdot n)$.
        \item<+-> \textbf{Remark:} Can be done in $\mathcal O(n)$ by doing some bookkeeping and storing for every colour the
            last time it occurred.
