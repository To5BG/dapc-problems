It is the most relaxing hobby of anyone's grandma: knitting!
Your grandma uses a lot of wool,
even for the most simple patterns that she is knitting.
You are sure that she can be more efficient with her wool,
so you decide to write a program that calculates the most efficient use of wool.

A knitting pattern is a long list of stitches,
where each stitch can use a different colour.\footnotemark{}
There is a cost for starting or ending the use of a certain colour,
for using the wool in a stitch,
and for letting it strand through the back unused.
For a given knitting pattern,
calculate the least possible amount of wool required
for every colour of wool.

\footnotetext{
    Most real-life knitting patterns are two-dimensional,
    but since you zig-zag through such a pattern while knitting,
    the input is one-dimensional for simplicity.
}

As an example, consider the first sample case.
There are three colours of wool (red, green, and blue).
The red wool is used at the start and at the end of the pattern:
it is most efficient to start and stop using the red wool for both parts separately ($4 \cdot 4 = 16$ cost),
and it is used in ten stitches ($10 \cdot 2 = 20$ cost),
giving a total cost of $36$.
The green and blue wool have the same cost:
start once ($4$ cost),
use for five stitches ($5 \cdot 2 = 10$ cost),
strand along the back for four stitches ($4 \cdot 1 = 4$ cost),
and stop using the colour ($4$ cost),
giving a total cost of $22$.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One line with three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($1\leq a < b < c\leq \maxa$),
            the cost of letting the wool strand through the back unused,
            the cost of using the wool in a stitch,
            and the cost of starting or ending the use of a colour of wool.
        \item One line with a string $w$ ($1 \leq |w| \leq 26$),
            representing the unique letters used for denoting stitch colours.
        \item One line with a string $p$ ($1 \leq |p| \leq \maxp$),
            representing the stitch colours of the knitting pattern.
    \end{itemize}
    All stitch colours use English lowercase letters (\texttt{a-z}).
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Output, for every colour of wool, in the order as they are in $w$,
    the amount of wool used in this pattern.
\end{Output}
