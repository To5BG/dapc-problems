You are working as a software developer for the Bug Acquisition Programming
Company. They developed a specific piece of software called Program C that they
sell to their clients. For the past weeks, you have been working on optimising a
specific function \texttt{foo} in the main code path in Program C. You have made
it a lot faster and would like to show off to your boss about it.

Your IDE has a nice tool that allows you to profile your code and tell you what
percentage of the total running time \texttt{foo} takes. You can run this on the
version before your change and after your change. However, you think it looks a
lot cooler if you can just tell your boss how much faster you have made
\texttt{foo} itself.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One line with two integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 < x, y < 100$),
        where $x$ is the percentage of the total running time that \texttt{foo} took before optimising
        and $y$ the percentage of the total running time it took after optimising.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Output the factor of how much faster \texttt{foo} got after your optimization.

    Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
