King Carl's kingdom contains $k$ keeps (commonly called castles).

Coordinates of keeps are known, and King Carl considers himself convinced that
it could be convenient to choose a central keep as King Carl's residence.

Critically, King Carl considers that the average cost to carry commands from
King Carl's residence to King Carl's other keeps should be small.

Compute the minimal average Euclidean distance\footnotemark{} from his residence keep to the
other keeps if King Carl chooses his residence optimally.
\footnotetext{
    The Euclidean distance between two points is the length of a straight line segment between these points.
}

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One line with an integer $k$ ($2\leq k\leq \maxn$), the number of keeps.
        \item $k$ lines, each with two integers $x$ and $y$ ($|x|, |y| \leq \maxx$), the coordinates of the keeps.
    \end{itemize}
    It is guaranteed that all keeps are at distinct locations.
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Output the minimal possible average distance from the keep that is chosen as the king's residence to all other keeps.

    Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
