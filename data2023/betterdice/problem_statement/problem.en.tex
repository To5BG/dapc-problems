The latest Table-Top Role Playing Game is out now: \emph{Better Dice}. Unlike
all other TTRPGs, this one is all about dice. In fact, it is all about
the \emph{better die}: decisions are made, friendships gained and lost,
fights fought, battles won, all based on who has the \emph{better die}.

This game uses special $n$-sided dice where each of the $n$ faces has the same
probability of being rolled. Moreover, each die has its own special set of $n$
numbers on the faces.

While playing \emph{Better Dice} you ended up in a very precarious situation where
you must absolutely have a \emph{better die} than your opponent, that is, you
must roll higher than your opponent. Given both your die and your opponent's die,
decide who is more likely to roll a higher number.


\begin{Input}
    The input consists of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item One line with an integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq \maxn$), the number of sides on each die.
        \item Two lines, each with $n$ integers $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 10^9$), the values on one of the dice.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Output ``\texttt{first}'' if the first die is more likely to roll a higher number than the second die.
    Output ``\texttt{second}'' if the second die is more likely to roll a higher number than the first die.
    Output ``\texttt{tie}'' if they are both equally likely to come up higher than the other.
\end{Output}
