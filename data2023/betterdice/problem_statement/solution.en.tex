        \item<+->[Problem:] Determine which of the two custom die is more likely to roll a higher number.
        \item<+->[Observation:] The dice are fair and only have up to $1000$ sides, so we can check all $n^2$ combinations.
        \item<+->[Solution:] For every combination, count whether the first or second die is better. \\
            Compare the total count for both dice to determine which die is more likely to roll a higher number.
