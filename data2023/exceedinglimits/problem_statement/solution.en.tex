        \item<+->[Problem:] Find the minimal amount of speeding to arrive on time.
        \item<+->[First check:] Perform Dijkstra to check if the destination can be reached on time without speeding.
        \item<+->[Observation:] Driving with different speeds may cause a different route to be faster.
        \item<+->[Observation:] If you can reach the destination with some amount of speeding, \\
            you can always reach the destination by speeding more.
        \item<+->[Solution:] Binary search on the amount of speeding, performing Dijkstra with the new speeds. \\
            If destination can be reached on time, try higher; else, try lower.
        \item<+->[Run time:] $\mathcal O((m + n \log m) \cdot \log t)$.
        \item<+->[Note:] Floating-point precision is not a problem, because of the low bounds on $t$ and $v$ ($10^5$).
