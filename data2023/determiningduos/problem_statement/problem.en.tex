    Typical example of a programming contest that you are coaching your students for.

As a coach of $2n$ students, you are making $n$ duos (teams of two) for the
upcoming programming contest season.
After the duos have been created, they will participate in $r$ contests,
each about a different topic: DP, graphs, geometry, etc.
You already ran a set of
internal selection contests to rank the students, and from this you were able to rank
all the students with a unique integer score between $1$ and $2n$
inclusive for each topic, with $2n$ being the best.

When a duo participates in a contest on a given topic, their score will be the
maximum of the two scores of the two students for this topic.

You think it would be amazing if summed up over all duos and contests, your
students could achieve a total score of at least $\targetscore$. Is this
possible?

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            One line with two integers \(n\) and \(r\) (\(1 \leq n \leq \maxn\), \(1 \leq r \leq \maxr\)), the number of duos and the number of topics.

        \item
            \(r\) lines, the \(i\)th of which contains \(2n\) integers \(x_{i,1}, \ldots, x_{i,2n}\) (\(1 \leq x_{i,j} \leq 2n\) for each \(i, j\))
            where \(x_{i,j}\) is the score of student \(j\) on topic \(i\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    If it is possible to make duos such that the total score over all duos and contests is at least $\targetscore$,
    output ``\texttt{possible}''.
    Otherwise, output ``\texttt{impossible}''.
\end{Output}
