        \item<+->[Problem:] Find a permutation of the English alphabet such that the strings are sorted.
        \item<+->[Observation:] Trying all permutations is too slow, but many permutations will be killed early.
        \item<+->[Preparation:] Instead of running over the entire list of words every time, create a graph, \\
            adding edges between the first differing pair of letters of two adjacent words:
